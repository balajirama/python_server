# python_server
 A python server template

# Steps
* Use the template repository to create your new repo on GitHub directly
   * Click the "Use this template" icon
   * Give you repo a name and description
   * GitHub generates the new repo for you
* Once your new repo has been generated, you can clone that repo to your computer
* Depending on which database (sqlite3 or MySQL) you want to use, start the server accordingly
   * Your page is up and running already!
* Start by editing the index.html page to edit the content
   * Use bootstrap code to make the content look nice
   * The master.html already uses the latest bootstrap components
* Start adding your routes and more code
